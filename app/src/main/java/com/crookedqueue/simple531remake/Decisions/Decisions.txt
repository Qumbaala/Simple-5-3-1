***Decisions Documentation***
-Decided to switch to buttons, dispite the obvious layout bloat, because we now have a limited number of potential options that are known ahead of time. This is to promote the simplicity that my userbase has come to appreciate
-Decided to manually set up the state-list drawables with each color in order to support pre-lollipop versions of android which represents about 20% of userbase
-Decided to use enums because they're nice
-Decided to eliminate some options, i.e. using personally designated warm-up percentages, in order to promote the "correctness" users have been noting in reviews
